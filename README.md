# pyna

**P**ython package dedicated for research on **DYNA**mic system.

Plan to support:
- One dimensional Map / Flow
- Two dimensional Map / Flow
    - Eigenvalue/vector
    - Asymptotic Behaviour Analysis
        - Topology Entropy (How bending are the curves after long-term evolution?)
        - Lyapunov Exponent Spectrum
    - Bifurcation diagram / Bifurcation curve 
    - Stable/Unstable manifold drawing
- Three dimensional Flow Visualization
