# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `pyna.topo.chaos`: skeleton module for chaotic region diagnostics — Chirikov
  overlap criterion (`chirikov_overlap`), finite-time Lyapunov exponent field
  (`ftle_field`), and chaotic boundary estimation (`chaotic_boundary_estimate`).
- `pyna.toroidal.optimize`: new subpackage for multi-objective stellarator
  optimisation; includes `neoclassical_epsilon_eff`, `xpoint_field_parallelism`,
  `magnetic_axis_position`, `wall_clearance`, and `compute_all_objectives`
  (all stubs with full docstrings and TODO markers ready for implementation).
- Updated `pyna.topo.__init__` to re-export chaos diagnostics.
